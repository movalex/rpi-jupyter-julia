This image is based on [https://github.com/movalex/rpi-jupyter-conda](https://github.com/movalex/rpi-jupyter-conda).
Build your own data-science jupyter notebook on your Raspberry Pi. 
This notebook server equipped with with Python 3.6.3 (Berryconda3 for Raspberry Pi installation)
and it uses resin/rpi-raspbian:jessie as base image. These packages are installed:

You can also play with the latest JupyterLab 0.31, just replace `tree` to `lab` in notebook URL.

    cython flask h5py numexpr pandas pillow pycrypto pytables scikit-learn

    scikit-image seaborn statsmodels vincent xlrd nltk

It also has latest [Julia 0.6.2](https://julialang.org/) notebook with all incredible stuff it goes with.
Have fun making plots with your Raspberry Pi. `Pyplot`, `Distributions`, `HDF5` and `Rdatasets` packages are preinstalled and compiled.

You can easily install additional packages manually via `conda install` or `pip install`.
This will work with unprivileged user, since all packages are installed in `opt/conda`, owned by this user.

## Installation and run

* download image with Docker:
    
    ```docker pull movalex/rpi-jupyter-julia```

* you can also use `pi_run_julia.sh` file from this repository to start container:

    `sh pi_run_julia.sh`

    - Change `$HOST_WORK_DIR` to whatever folder you want to syncronize your docker container with.
    - use `-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \` to syncronize your local date/time with image.

    IMAGE=${1:-'movalex/rpi-jupyter-julia:0.6.2'}
    HOST_WORK_DIR=$HOME/docker/work
    docker run -d -p 8889:8888 --name jp -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v $HOST_WORK_DIR:/home/jovyan/work "$IMAGE"
